# Advanced algorithms like this are out of my wheel house. I really struggled with this one and could not dedicate more time to it.
# Luckily, I have never needed to do anything remotely close to this in my line of work.
# Unless you are looking for a developer to work on advanced algorithms, I would not recommend having something like this on a coding interview.
# It is frustrating because this is not a strength of mine, but I do not believe it needs to be a strength for a software developer in test.
# That being said, I could have gotten this done by copying some other code off the internet, but I decided not to do that since I felt that would defeat the purpose.
# I'd recommend something more practical for the job application. For example, had you asked me to automate testing of some website or application, I could have done that with ease.
