## Execute
The step 3 is implemented in the same project degree-of-separations (step 2). 
Insert it here again will only duplicate the code.

It's a GET Rest API service, open the browse and type the url 
'http://localhost:8080/degree-of-separation?actor1=Tom Cruise&actor2=Julie Andrews'

Ps.: actor1 is required, actor2 is NOT required

actor1 and actor2 are parameters, they can be changed

the response will be something similar to this:

> Degree of Separation: 2
> 
> Tom Cruise starred with Shelley Long in Losin' It
> 
> Shelley Long starred with Sela Ward in Hello Again
> 
> Sela Ward starred with Julie Andrews in The Man Who Loved Women
