FYI, I have never done windows development, so I'm not familiar with powershell.

That said, my best bets are:

1.  It looks like it's trying to run a script on the guest operating system named "WPM" from the host machine.
It's checking to see if the scripts exist and reporting errors to the host machine when they don't.

2.  It looks like it assumes that you have access to actually run the commands that can execute on the
  guest machines.

3.  The WOW6432Node indicates that you're running on a 64-bit version of windows.
