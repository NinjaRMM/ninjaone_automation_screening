Please review the below code and answer the following questions to the best of your ability:

1.) What is this code doing?

First, it is opening a Virtual machine and checking if NinjaWPM is installed on it,
as it is checking if the registry exists, returning Success (True) if so and Failure otherwise (False 0).
Second, as the previous statement is Success, it later checks in the same VM if there is a Windows installer executable
for NinjaWPM on the path provided.
If both registry and the .exe exist, the script ends without errors.

2.) What does the program assume you need to have access to in order to execute?

It assumes the user should have read access to the folder containing the virtual machine.
VMware Tools should be installed. Credentials to authenticate with the host.

3.) What architectures can this script run on?

It can be run on Win-64 bits architecture, as the path 'WOW6432Node' means Ninja is 32bit app on 64-bit Windows.
