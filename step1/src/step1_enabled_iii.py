import subprocess

# Comments:
# On my research I first went through 2 directions:
# 1. An API to interact through terminal.
# 2. Getting this information from the Windows Registry
#
# For the nunmber 1, I couldnÂ´t find something easy to implement,
# while for number 2, I found results very dependend on the OS version.
# I realized that the policy to disable automatic updates are different
# from one Win version to another, with distict locations on the Registry.
#
# Due to that, I looked foward getting the status of the Windows Update service,
# because if it is not running, the automatic updates will not happen.
