# Step1

To execute the program, run:
```sh
java -jar bin/step1.jar [--verifyAutoUpdate]
```
_PS.: I'm versioning the .jar inside `bin` folder so you don't have to compile it. Please note that I wouldn't do this in a "real project"_

To compile the project using Maven, run:
```sh
mvn package
```

To execute unit tests, run:
```sh
mvn test
```
