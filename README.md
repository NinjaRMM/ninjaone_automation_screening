# NinjaOne Screening Challenge

## General comments

### Step 1

The questions were answered to the best of my knowledge, but for some of them, I didn't have the experience myself, so I did my research and tried to come up with sensible answers. Not having the experience was especially true for the small programming challenges, and for this reason, I chose to answer straight on the file.

### Step 2

Fun challenge, for which I even implemented Cucumber tests to execute the `.feature` file (on which I did minor adjustments). Running structions can be found on `step2/src/RUNME.md`, as required on the assignment.

### Step 3

Great challenge, with a very funny easter egg I found around 3am. No Cucumber implementation for this one, though. Running structions can be found on `step3/src/RUNME.md`.

### Step 4

Again, I had to research the docs and answered to the best of my interpretation.

# Final considerations

I am glad to have been given the opportunity to participate in this hiring process, for I was able to learn so much and deepen my knowledge on modern tools.

If I were to spend some more hours on this challenge, I would:

- somehow test all scripts for steps 1 and 4;
- improve step3's Gherkin file, to create a single class for running all scenarios;
- try to find (and handle) more edge cases for commandline applications;
- remove stack trace, return only the exception message on errors for commandline applications.
